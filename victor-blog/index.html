          <p><strong>Hello</strong>, and <strong>welcome</strong> to my blog. You could've gone to one of millions of blogs out there on the internet, but something made you come here, and for that I thank. I will try my hardest to make my entries at the very least insightful if not entertaining. In this blog, I'm going to talk about the things I love, which may include topics like, but not limited to, music,food, and travel. Those are the fun things, but I also have had a life long mission of creating social change and awarness through my music. Not everyone loves the trumpet, so I'm blogging now...there's more than one way to...(insert culturally relevent saying here).</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="bio">Born in San Francisco, CA, raised in Seattle, WA, educated in Boston, MA (Berklee '07), refined in Philadelphia, and now back in the musical richness of the PNW, I have always played my horn in musicallyÂ­ fertile cities. Starting at the age of 6 on the clarinet and then to trumpet at nine, I've always knew music would be a lifelong journey for me, so I worked on honing my skills and have tried diligently to keep practicing. I would say my hard work at an early age is what earned me a scholarship to Berklee College of Music. Going to school for music changed my concept of music forever! While in school, I immersed myself into the Boston Music scene and studied with some amazing professors that always challenged me musically.Through the years I has also made an effort to study independently and hounded some of my favorite artists to give me music lessons, I had and have no shame in asking people to teach me something. I believe this attitude led me to performance opportunities with world-reknown artists like <em>Gloria Estefan</em> and the <em>Chieftains</em>.</p>

          <p>I won't expect any millenials to get that...lol. I wanted to share some pics from my last trip. I was raised in <em>Bernal Heights</em><img src="img/Bernalheights.jpg"> but spent alot of time in the <strong>Mission District</strong> riding around with my pop listening to this guy <img src="img/santana.jpg">. Nowadays it's known as the valley of the <strong>$8 lattes!!!</strong> Time changes everything, right? Well, not everything. Although most people I grew up with would agree that they don't recognize the San Francisco they grew up with, I was pleased to see that my culture is still being represented...well, on the walls of buildings at least.</p>
